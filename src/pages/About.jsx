            I'm passionate about applying statistical methods and computational techniques to solve 
            real-world problems. My work focuses on data analysis, statistical modeling, and software 
            development, with a particular interest in how mathematical insights can be translated 
            into practical applications. Through my studies in Applied Statistics and complementary 
            minors in Mathematical Sciences and Computer Science, I've developed a unique perspective 
            that bridges theory and implementation.

            I'm drawn to complex problems that require both analytical rigor and creative thinking—whether 
            that's building predictive models, developing data-driven solutions, or creating software 
            that makes statistical analysis more accessible. My academic focus centers on advanced 
            statistical methods, probability theory, and computational statistics, while my practical 
            experience has emphasized the importance of clean code, effective visualization, and 
            clear communication of results.

            As I look toward my professional future, I'm excited to work in roles where I can leverage 
            my analytical skills to drive data-informed decisions. I'm particularly interested in 
            opportunities in data science, statistical consulting, or software development teams that 
            work on analytical tools. My goal is to continue growing as both a statistician and a 
            developer, contributing to projects that make a meaningful impact through the thoughtful 
            application of statistical and computational methods.
